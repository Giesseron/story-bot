# Claude Code — Project Rules

## Role

You must prioritize planning, clarity, and safety over speed.

## Workflow (MANDATORY)
- Always propose a short plan before writing code.
- Break work into small, incremental steps.
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear.
- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions.

## Safety & Risk
- Do not make destructive changes without explicit confirmation.
- Flag risky decisions and propose safer alternatives.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

## Documentation
- Explain architectural decisions briefly.
- Update relevant docs when behavior changes.
- Keep explanations concise and factual.

## Scope
- Work only within the current project directory.
- Do not assume technologies unless explicitly stated.
